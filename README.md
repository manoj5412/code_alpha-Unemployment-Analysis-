Unemployment Analysis with Python:

This project analyzes unemployment trends using Python. The dataset represents the unemployment rate (percentage of unemployed people) over a time period. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and insights into how unemployment changes over time, with a special focus on the impact of COVID-19.

Project Overview:

The main objectives of this project are:

To clean and preprocess the unemployment dataset.

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on unemployment trends.

To visualize unemployment patterns across time and regions.

To study the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates.

To identify seasonal patterns or anomalies.

To generate insights that could help in economic and social policy planning.

Dataset Information:

The dataset includes:

Date / Time period

Region / State (if available)

Unemployment rate (%)

Other attributes depending on dataset source

Size: Varies depending on dataset used

Technologies Used:

Python 3

Libraries:

numpy → numerical computations

pandas → data manipulation

matplotlib & seaborn → visualization

plotly → interactive visualizations

scikit-learn → optional (for trend analysis / forecasting)

Steps Involved:

Data Collection

Load dataset (CSV / Excel / online source).

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values.

Convert dates to proper datetime format.

Remove duplicates and check data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics of unemployment rates.

Check regional differences.

Compare pre-COVID and post-COVID unemployment.

Visualization

Line plots for unemployment trends.

Bar charts for state/region-wise unemployment.

Heatmaps to identify seasonal or regional variations.

Insights & Impact of COVID-19

Highlight how unemployment rose during pandemic lockdowns.

Identify recovery patterns in later months.

How to Run:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/unemployment-analysis-python.git
cd unemployment-analysis-python](https://github.com/manoj5412/code_alpha-Unemployment-Analysis-.git)


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook unemployment_analysis.ipynb

Results & Insights:

Unemployment spiked during COVID-19 lockdowns (2020).

Certain regions recovered faster while others lagged behind.

Seasonal variations in some areas (e.g., agricultural cycles).

Clear evidence that economic shocks (like pandemics) strongly affect employment.

Applications:

Helps governments and policymakers to design economic strategies.

Useful for sociologists and researchers studying employment patterns.

Can be extended for predictive modeling using time series forecasting.
